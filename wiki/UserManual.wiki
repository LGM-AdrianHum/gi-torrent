#summary giTorrent User Manual.

= Introduction =

This is the first attempt to create a user manual for giTorrent. 


= Details =
*Setting up the connection*

The connection tab contains the information for giTorrent to reach rTorrent on the server. There are 5 parameters to set :

* URL          The url that points to your webserver.
*  Port         The port that your webserver uses, default port 80.
* Mount Point  The link to the RPC interface, default '/RPC2'.
* UserID       The userid defined in the webserver if you enabled security.
* Password     The password defined in the webserver if you enabled security.

See [http://code.google.com/p/gi-torrent/w/edit/giTorrent_web_server_install Web Server Install] for details.

*Getting a Torrent list*

rTorrent is based on views to show the active torrents. The default views are supported in giTorrent:
{{{
- All      All the torrents in the list, actually the 'main' view in rTorrent.
- Started  All the torrents that are active.
- Stopped  All the torrents that are inactive.
- Hashing  All the torrents that are hashing or waiting for hashing. 
- Seeding  All the torrents that are fully downloaded and seeding.
}}}
giTorrent has these views accessable through the 'View' menu. Choosing a view from the menu gets the information from rTorrent, so initially the list is empty until a view is selected.
